# Zenarmor Landing Page Redesign - Project Context

## Project Overview

**Client:** Zenarmor (Asha - stakeholder)
**Project:** B2B SASE Landing Page Redesign
**Developer:** Cristian Prodius
**Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion

---

## Strategic Pivot (from Meeting Notes)

### Business Shift
- **FROM:** B2C/practitioner focus → **TO:** B2B SASE platform for mid-market
- **Target Audience:** Mid-market organizations with 1-5 person IT teams, distributed employees
- **Core Message:** "Purpose-built, single-stack SASE solution" (not stitched acquisitions like Palo Alto/Zscaler)
- **New Tagline:** "Plug SASE Everywhere" (replacing "Plug & Secure")

### Key Differentiators
1. **Deploy in minutes, not months** (vs traditional 3-6 months)
2. **Endpoint inspection** reduces latency and prevents cloud POP outages
3. **Single-stack architecture** vs competitor acquisitions
4. **Built for small IT teams** (1-5 people can manage)

## Client Requirements (from Email - Oct 21, 2025)

### Must-Have Interactive Elements

1. **Interactive Widgets** (inspiration: https://www.qlik.com/us)
   - Clickable widgets at top providing more info
   - Engaging, information-rich on interaction

2. **Platform Demo Sandbox** (inspiration: https://www.elisity.com/platform)
   - 30-second demo snapshot users can view instantly
   - No forced trial walkthrough
   - Interactive tabbed interface showing features
   - Actual product UI snapshots

3. **ROI Calculator Hook**
   - Client provided: `docs/Zenarmor_ROI_Calculator.xlsx`
   - Make this a prominent hook/widget on main page
   - Show concrete savings/value proposition

4. **CTA Changes**
   - REMOVE: Email collection forms
   - ADD: Trial sign-up CTAs
   - ADD: ROI calculator links
   - ADD: Quick demo previews

  - Each tab shows actual ZenConsole UI screenshot/video
  - Highlights key features with checkmarks:
    - "Zero-touch provisioning"
    - "500+ endpoints secured in 12 mins"
  - CTAs: "Try Full Demo" + "Schedule Walkthrough"
  - Position: After Hero, before Features
  - Inspiration: Elisity's platform tour

### Phase 4: Interactive Features Section
**File to modify:**
- [ ] [src/sections/Features.tsx](src/sections/Features.tsx)
  - Convert static cards to tabbed interface
  - Tabs: [ZTNA] [SSE] [SD-WAN] [Cloud Security]
  - Each tab reveals detailed info on hover/click
  - Emphasize single-stack architecture
  - Add architecture diagram visual
  - Highlight: "Built for 1-5 person IT teams"

### Phase 5: Enhanced Integrations

    - "2,000+ Policies enforced"
    - "2 Days to deploy"
    - "Zero downtime during AWS outage" (competitive differentiator)
  - Clickable cards revealing full case study
  - Position: After Features

### Phase 7: Comparison Widget (ROI Extended)

    - Annual cost: $450K+ vs $127K
    - IT overhead: 5-10 FTEs vs 1-2 FTEs
    - Architecture: Cloud POPs vs Endpoint
  - Clickable cards with tooltips for details
  - CTA: "Calculate Your Savings"

## CTA Strategy (All CTAs Must Update)

### Primary CTAs
1. **"Start Free Trial"** - Main conversion goal
2. **"Calculate ROI"** - Secondary hook, leads to trial
3. **"View 30s Demo"** - Low-commitment engagement

### Secondary CTAs
4. **"Schedule Demo"** - Sales-qualified leads
5. **"Read Case Study"** - Social proof path

### Remove Entirely
- ❌ "Enter your email" / Newsletter forms
- ❌ Generic "Get Started" without trial context

---

## Key Messaging Guidelines

### Target Audience Language
- "Mid-market organizations"
- "1-5 person IT teams"
- "Distributed workforce" (remote, travel, multiple offices)
- "Deploy in minutes, not months"

### Differentiation Points
- "Purpose-built single-stack SASE" (vs stitched acquisitions)
- "Endpoint-based architecture" (vs cloud POP dependency)
- "Works even when cloud POPs fail" (AWS outage resilience)
- "Simple enough for small IT teams"

### Pain Points to Address
- Complex deployments (traditional takes 3-6 months)
- Steep learning curves
- High IT overhead requirements
- Cloud POP outages forcing security bypass
- High costs ($450K+ for traditional)

## Design Reference Sites

1. **Qlik.com** - Interactive widgets providing info on click
2. **Elisity.com/platform** - Tabbed demo interface, customer metrics, categorized integrations

---

## Technical Notes

### Existing Patterns to Leverage
- Framer Motion for animations (already used in Hero, CallToAction)
- Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Component composition pattern
- Server/client component split (`"use client"` directive)

### New Dependencies Needed (Maybe)
- Tooltip library (Radix UI Tooltip or Headless UI)
- Tabs component (Radix UI Tabs or custom)
- Modal/Dialog for expanded ROI calculator

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load demo videos/screenshots
- Use Next.js Image component for all images
- Keep animations performant (use transform/opacity)

## Notes for AI Assistants

When working on this project:
- Prioritize Phase 1 messaging updates first (quick wins)
- Always reference meeting notes context (B2C → B2B pivot)
- Keep small IT teams in mind (simplicity matters)
- Emphasize speed (minutes not months) and cost savings
- Use interactive patterns inspired by Qlik and Elisity
- ROI calculator is a critical "hook" - make it engaging
- All new work should drive toward trial sign-ups
