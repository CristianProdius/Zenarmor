Meeting Purpose

Review a website draft and align on the new B2B marketing strategy.
Key Takeaways

    Strategic Pivot: The company is shifting from B2C to a B2B focus on SASE for mid-market clients, making the current website obsolete.

    New Messaging: The core message is a "purpose-built, single-stack SASE solution" that is simple to deploy (minutes vs. months) and performs inspection on the endpoint to avoid cloud-POP-related outages.

    Website Architecture: The public homepage will be SASE-focused. B2C and other segments will be served by private landing pages for targeted marketing campaigns, preserving the B2B brand.

    Action Plan: Ken will revise the draft using new materials (sales playbook, messaging) from Asha, who will also share HubSpot landing pages for feedback.

Topics
Strategic Pivot: B2C → B2B SASE

    The company is pivoting from a B2C/practitioner focus to a B2B SASE platform for mid-market clients.

    Target Audience: Mid-market organizations (1–5 person IT teams) with distributed employees (remote, travel, multiple offices).

    Key Pain Points:

        Need for a simple, fast-to-deploy SASE solution (minutes, not months).

        Buyers may not know "SASE" but understand network security and access problems.

    Brand Messaging:

        Differentiator: A purpose-built, single-stack SASE solution, unlike competitors (Palo Alto, Zscaler) who stitch together acquisitions.

        Performance: Endpoint inspection reduces latency and prevents outages, unlike cloud-POP-dependent models that can force users to bypass security (e.g., during the recent AWS issue).

        New Tagline: "Plug SASE Everywhere" will replace "Plug & Secure" to better reflect the platform's value and avoid B2C connotations.

Website Draft Review & Feedback

    Ken's draft, a light-theme landing page built in ~8 hours, was reviewed.

    Goal: Collect emails for marketing.

    Feedback:

        Theme: Light theme is approved; dark themes may be used for specific landing pages.

        CTA: The CTA must change from email collection to driving SASE trial sign-ups.

        Content: The draft is a good starting point but needs to be rewritten with the new B2B messaging.

Technical & SEO Audit

    The current website has poor SEO structure, which hurts search ranking.

    Key Issues:

        Semantic HTML errors (e.g., <p> tags styled as headers instead of <h1>).

        Missing accessibility features.

    Ken will provide a full list of technical SEO issues.

Proposed Website Architecture

    A multi-page architecture will serve all audiences while maintaining a strong B2B SASE brand.

    Public Homepage (zenarmer.com):

        Focus: Exclusively on the SASE platform.

        Navigation:

            Platform → Our Story, Architecture

            Solutions → SASE, ZTNA, SSE

        Pricing: Only show B2B SASE/SSE plans.

    Private Landing Pages:

        Purpose: Serve specific audiences (B2C, Next-Gen Firewall) via targeted marketing campaigns.

        Access: Only via direct links (email, ads); not discoverable on the public site.

        Current Use: Three HubSpot landing pages exist for mid-market verticals (healthcare, insurance, finance).

Next Steps

    Asha:

        Share the sales playbook, messaging guide, and "Plug SASE Everywhere" memo.

        Share the HubSpot landing pages with Ken and Cristian.

        Send meeting notes to Ken.

    Ken:

        Revise the website draft using the new materials.

        Send the updated draft and the Figma file to Asha.

        Provide the list of technical SEO issues from the current site.
